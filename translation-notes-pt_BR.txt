Translation notes:
1) Some stuttering and humming were removed in order to improve student's understanding.
2) Ghost elements was translated to "elementos fantasmas". This can be put back in english according to the preference of other translators.
3) Some discourse markers were removed since its translation would sound strange or could cause some loss of student's understanding of the topic on the sentence.
4) Plenty of Text-To-Speech errors in the subtitles were found and corrected.
